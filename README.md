# Restaurant and Meal Logger

Ever stare blankly at the menu and try to remember what you ordered last time you were at the restaurant (or whether you liked what you ordered)? This is a basic Sinatra application for logging restaurants and meals, so you always know what you got last time (even if last time was a couple years ago).

## Installation
1. Clone this repo and `bundle install` to make sure you have all the right gem dependencies
2. Run `rake db:migrate` to set up your database


## Usage

To get started, run `shotgun` in your terminal and open the local server in a new browser tab (likely http://localhost:9393/ but follow the port indicated in your terminal).

From there, the application should be self-explanatory. Once you sign up, you'll be able to add, view, edit, and delete all your restaurants and dishes.
